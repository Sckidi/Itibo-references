              <span class="quest">Introduce your business and what you do there.</span>
              <p>The company is SequenceBase Corporation. We produce a database of worldwide genetic patented genes. Users are generally from drug development companies, biotech companies, etc. I’m president and CEO.</p>
              </br>
              <span class="quest">What challenge were you trying to address with Azati?</span>
              <p>We needed a comprehensive website and portal to use as part of our ongoing business.</p>
              </br>
              <span class="quest">What was the scope of their involvement?</span>
              <p>Azati developed our website, which is a research portal. They put together data from 20 to 25 different sources. They put it in a form where users would be able to read and manipulate it very readily. In addition to that, in order to search genetic sequences, there’s an algorithm that’s used. They were able to develop additional algorithms that work very fast and more accurately than what we had before. Our users seem to love it. When a potential customer comes to the site, we can put together a trial and show them what we offer. They can try it out and will hopefully sign up for a subscription. Once they have the subscription, they’re able to search genetic sequences and see if they’ve been patented anywhere in the world. They can export the report, manipulate it, add additional generic profiles to it, and then enhance the report or whatever they want. This is a difficult subject dealing with bioinformatics, or more specifically genetics, DNA, nucleotides, and proteins, and not many people know this area of expertise. I was happy with Azati because they were able to step up to the plate and put everything together for me in a pretty good fashion.</p>
              </br>
              <span class="quest">What is the team composition?</span>
              <p>I had a previous business called Patent Value Predictor that they developed a web portal for. For that one, we had an algorithm that would put a value on a patent based on certain parameters. We were pleased with the work they did for that portal and, when I started SequenceBase, I knew who to turn to. I knew I could give them a complex project that very few people would have a background in and they would be able to create a knowledge base and move forward fairly quickly. I found them easy to work with.</p>
              </br>
              <span class="quest">What was the team composition?</span>
              <p>Before working with Azati, I collaborated with some part-time developers, but I decided that if I
                wanted to take this to the next level, I needed a group of professionals. A friend recommended Azati
                after having a successful project with them. I found positive online reviews of their work, and I had a
                chance to speak with the owner and with the business analyst that is currently assigned to this project.
                They appeared to be quite experienced, and I had a good feeling about selecting them.</p>
              </br>
              <span class="quest">How did you come to work with Azati?</span>
              <p>I had a previous business called Patent Value Predictor that they developed a web portal for. For that one, we had an algorithm that would put a value on a patent based on certain parameters. We were pleased with the work they did for that portal and, when I started SequenceBase, I knew who to turn to. I knew I could give them a complex project that very few people would have a background in and they would be able to create a knowledge base and move forward fairly quickly. I found them easy to work with.</p>
              </br>
              <span class="quest">How much have you invested with them?</span>
              <p>We have spent between $200,000 and $300,000 over the course of our relationship.</p>
              </br>
              <span class="quest">What is the status of this engagement?</span>
              <p>We started working with them in 2012 or 2013, and the work is ongoing.</p>
              </br>
              <span class="quest">What evidence can you share that demonstrates the impact of the engagement?</span>
              <p>reason we’ve been successful. Our web portal is workflow-oriented. They create a project and have certain steps they follow. Azati was able to make a web portal that follows the way any research scientist or attorney would work without any prior training. We don’t offer much in the way of customer support because it’s self-supporting. There’s a user manual as well. I don’t have a lot of time to handle a lot of customer inquiries. Wherever a customer might run into a problem, there’s a question mark and they just click that and there’s content-sensitive help that gives them the answer to the question. My goal was to have very little support needed from me, and Azati was able to accomplish that. Customers like it because they don’t have to learn a new way to work in order to fit their workflow into our web portal.</p>
              </br>
              <span class="quest">How did Azati perform from a project management standpoint?</span>
              <p>They’re really easy to work with. I don’t have a lot of time to manage, so I only want to see the end result and they’re able to produce that with very little input on my part. Everything was delivered on time and within budget.</p>
              </br>
              <span class="quest">What did you find most impressive about them?</span>
              <p>They have the ability to learn a fairly complex subject very quickly. Bioinformatics is not an easy topic and there’s not very many people around. If they couldn’t have learned it, they couldn’t produce the end product. There’s very few people that have coding experience and are able to develop a web portal that would have a bioinformatics background. We continue to move forward as they enhance the product.</p>
              </br>
              <span class="quest">Are there any areas they could improve?</span>
              <p>I’ve never had a problem.</p>
              </br>
              <span class="quest">Are there any areas they could improve?</span>
              <p>Like any startup, we’re still learning so much about ourselves at this early stage. I don’t have anything negative to say about Azati because they’ve adapted to our style each time we’ve changed it in the past 10 or 11 months.</p>
